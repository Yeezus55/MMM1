  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The Canadian Tribunal of human rights, the second Bootcamp group project,
    was a pivotal experience I led as a UX Designer. In this role, I
    orchestrated our team to develop a user-centric redesign for a government
    agency. My key contributions to this project included conducting
    in-depth user research, designing wireframes and prototypes, and integrating
    user feedback for iterative improvement. This lead to a overall better
    visual and performing website while at the same thing adapting our learning
    experience as a UI/UX Designer.
  </p>
  <h2>Role: UI Designer/ UX Research</h2>
  <h2>Timeline: 3 Weeks</h2>
  <h2>Tools: Canva, Google Doc, Figma</h2>
  <h2>Team: 2</h2>

  <h1>Project goal</h1>
  <p>
    Our primary objective is to address the accessibility deficiencies of the
    current CHRT website while bringing its design and functionality in line
    with government standards. This involves conducting tests to identify and
    rectify barriers for users with disabilities, alongside a redesign process
    aimed at modernizing the website's appearance and usability. Our goal is to
    ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines and create a visually
    appealing, user-friendly platform that meets the expectations of modern web
    standards.
  </p>

  <h1>User Research</h1>
  <p>
    Our team embarked on a research journey aimed at deeply understanding users'
    interactions with the CHRT website. Through comprehensive methods such as
    surveys, interviews, and usability testing, we unearthed insights into their
    journeys, preferences, and frustrations. Armed with this knowledge, we
    identified areas of strength and opportunities for enhancement. Our roadmap
    prioritizes user-centric improvements, focusing on streamlining navigation,
    enhancing accessibility, and refining content to create a more intuitive and
    valuable platform. With each step, our commitment to fostering a seamless
    and enriching user experience remains unwavering, driving us toward our
    vision of digital excellence.

  <p>Heuristic evaluations shed light on critical areas of improvement for the CHRT website. While the content was deemed satisfactory, concerns arose regarding the complexity and cleanliness of the design. Accessibility tests highlighted failures related to color schemes and font sizes.
    Additionally, the small back home button was deemed ineffective and space-consuming, while the crowded and diminutive navigation bar compounded usability issues. Furthermore, the absence of a clear hierarchy contributed to a cluttered appearance. By addressing these findings, we aim to overhaul the website, ensuring simplicity, accessibility, and navigational clarity for an enhanced user experience.</p>
    <h1> Usability tests</h1>
    <p>During the CHRT redesign Project, we conducted four usability tests to inform our design and and iterate any changes that should be made. The tests were structured around the objectives that were previously mentioned. </p>

    <div class="test">
      <h3>Irene C.
        said:
        "These buttons are too small!"
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Nick P.
        said:
        "This website looks like it was pilled from the 00's"
      </h3>

        said:
        "Said it was too clutter and overly complicated"
      </h3>
    </div>
    <p>Usability testing uncovered challenges with navigating back to the homepage and perceived complexity within the CHRT website. Participants struggled with small, unclear buttons, highlighting the need for key improvements:

      Enhance font size and button clarity to improve readability and usability.
      Increase the size and visibility of the home/back button for easier navigation.
      Refine the site's hierarchy to streamline navigation and enhance user experience.
     Ensure color choices meet accessibility standards to accommodate diverse user needs.</p>
